# install_opencv_ubuntu18
Bash script to install OpenCV on Ubuntu 18.04.01

After numerous attempts at getting cmake to install OpenCV properly, I finally found out how to
get the install to complete.
All of the code is from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/
and written by Adrian Rosebrock, published on May 28th, 2018.
All I did was add it to a bash script to streamline the installation on other machines for projects.
Nonetheless, the author'ss method has been the only method that works for me.  Full attribution to Adrian 
Rosebrock.  Good job and Thank You!

Ths script may not be flawless.  To date, I have not tested the script therefor there are no guarantees 
whatsoever.  I also intend to add to the script for alternative operations in the event an install fails.

Per the usual;
cd to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the script
chmod +x install_opencv_ubuntu18
sudo bash install_opencv_ubuntu18


Lastly, I am into collaboration and would enjoy the input and alterations of others with pleasure.
